Late in switching over to GA4, or just looking for help in setting it up in the first
place on your Astro website? Let's go through how to set it up.

## Introduction

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is Google's replacement for Universal Analytics. Whether we wanted it or not, ~~we've stepped into a war with the cabal on mars~~ UA is being deprecated on July 1, 2023. At the time of this posting that's just over a week away!

### What is a Tag?

Tags are simply snippets of code or tracking pixels. They are used to collect data from your website and send it to the third-party tool. For example, Google Analytics uses a tag to collect data about your website visitors and send it to Google Analytics (that's why you're here).

## Setup GA4 Property

1. First you need to create your GA4 property. You can do this at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Follow the instructions until you you get to where you choose a platform. Select "web"
3. Put in your website address and give it a name
4. "Create Stream"

Now there will be a popup for installation instructions to add your Google tag manually (since this is for a custom site). If you use a tool like MonsterInsights, Shopify, or other, then the appropriate instructions for those should come up instead.

## GA4 Implementation Options

You have two options to add GA4 to your website. You can either add the GA4 tag code to your website directly, or you can add the code for Google Tag Manager and setup Tag Manager to add GA4. Tag Manager allows you to manage ALL your tags in one place without you having to later update the code.

Tag Manager can add the code for other tags such as:

- Adwords Remarketing
- Adwords Conversion Tracking
- heatmap tracking code (like Hotjar)
- Facebook pixels
- Cookiebot and other GDPR data privacy scripts

I implement GA4 on my websites using Google Tag Manager, but you can make that decision yourself. Both implementations are below.

### GA4 Tag Directly

At this point, you _can_ copy the Google Tag code it shows to put in the `<head>` of your website. Specific to astro though, you need to alter this script slightly.

The script google gives you looks like the below, where `G-XXXXXXXXXX` needs to be replaced with your GA4 Measurement ID.

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"
></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());

  gtag("config", "G-XXXXXXXXXX");
</script>
```

The code to put in Astro for our `<head>` needs to have `<script is:inline>`. This makes it so astro puts the script into the webpage code as-is instead of optimizing it. See the [astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#isinline) for more details. The implementation will look like the below.

```html
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"
></script>
<script is:inline>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());

  gtag("config", "G-XXXXXXXXXX");
</script>
```

### GA4 Using Google Tag Manager

Go to [tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com/) and, using the same google account, create a tag manager account.

It will then give you the code to setup tag manager. Just like the GA4 tag, we need the `is:inline` directive. For this you need both code in the head and body of the website. Note: you'll need to replace "GTM-XXXXXXX" with your GTM container id.

```html
<!-- This is in <head> -->
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script is:inline>
  (function (w, d, s, l, i) {
    console.log("GTM");
    w[l] = w[l] || [];
    w[l].push({ "gtm.start": new Date().getTime(), event: "gtm.js" });
    var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
      j = d.createElement(s),
      dl = l != "dataLayer" ? "&l=" + l : "";
    j.async = true;
    j.src = "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=" + i + dl;
    f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f);
  })(window, document, "script", "dataLayer", "GTM-XXXXXXX");
</script>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
```

```html
<!-- This is opening of <body> -->
<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
<noscript>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX"
    height="0"
    width="0"
    style="display:none;visibility:hidden"
  >
  </iframe>
</noscript>
<!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
```

## Data Layer with GTM

Google also recommends you setup the data layer within your code too. You can do this with the below code. The data layer is an object used by Google Tag Manager and gtag.js to pass information to tags. These could be events or variables, where triggers can be set up based on the values of variables. For further info, see [Google's docs](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/web/datalayer). This code needs to be **BEFORE** the Google Tag Manager code.

<!-- explain the google analytics data layer -->

```html
<!-- in <head> before GTM code -->
<script is:inline>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
</script>
```

## Configure GTM to Fire GA4 Tag

Now that you have GTM setup on your website, you need to tell setup GTM to fire the GA4 tag for you. This is done by creating a tag and a trigger. Starting in your Tag Manager workspace:

1. click "Tags" in the left menu. Then click "New" to create a new tag
2. Click "Tag Configuration" and select "Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration"
3. Put in your measurement ID from Google Analytics
   - Looks like "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
4. Click "Triggering" and select "All Pages"
5. Add an additional trigger for "Initialization - All Pages"

## Test Your GA4 Implementation

You can test your GA4 implementation at [tagassistant.google.com](https://tagassistant.google.com/). This will tell you if you have any errors in your implementation. Notes:

- Make sure your browser is not blocking cookies
- Make sure you are not using an ad blocker

## What About Consent?

You need to make sure you are not tracking users without their consent. This is especially important if you are tracking users in the EU. You can use certain tools out there through this, or roll your own implementation. I have created my own basic implementation so far but that's a topic for another day.

Basically, you can setup your code to have GA4 automatically deny all consent, then call a function to update GA4 with the consent when it is accepted by the user. This can be tracked in a cookie in the user's browser.
