## Effective UI

UI is **U**ser **I**nterface. Manage attention with effective UI.

Define your hirearchy of what you want the reader to give attention. Most important should be conveyed first. Define by:

- Colors that pop
- Size - larger stands out more
- Layout - keep it interesting

Aim for 40-60 characters wide for text blocks.

Keep alignment the same for the same sections.

- Ex. between header and text
- Reduce the number of alignment points overall

Space things out - use whitespace - it makes things look more expensive.

Design for your audience.

- Ex. make it fun if it's for kids

## UX Design

UX is **U**ser e**X**perience. Make it easy for the user to do what they want to do.

1. Simplicity

   - Keep it simple, stupid!

2. Consistency

   - Keep the functionality of the product similar between parts of the website
     - Ex. keep the nav bar the same

3. Reading Pattern

   - Use the F-Layout - people start at top left, read to right, then down left, then right, then down left, etc
   - Or the Z-Layout - start top left, then top right, then bottom left to bottom right

4. All Platform Design

   - Websites have to work on all platforms!
   - Mobile first design - most people view websites on mobile now
   - Don't have a ton of banners on mobile

5. Don't use your powers for evil

   - Don't use dark patterns - things that are good for company but bad for user that you try to get user to do
   - Don't be a Ryanair, or a time-share salesman
